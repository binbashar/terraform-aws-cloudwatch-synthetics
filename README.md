We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-alarms/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic Example
```hcl
  module "target-canary" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-synthetics.git?ref=FEATURE/improving-module"
  
    name_prefix = "canary"
    environment = "test"
  
    schedule_expression = "rate(5 minutes)"
    s3_artifact_bucket  = "my-test-artifact-bucket" # must pre-exist
    alarm_email         = null      # an email or null value
    endpoints           = { "target-group" = { url = "http://www.binbash.co/" } }
    managedby           = "managedby@binbash.co"
    repository          = "https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-synthetics"
  
    # what networks it has to work in?
    subnet_ids                = data.terraform_remote_state.local-vpcs.outputs.private_subnets
    security_group_ids        = [aws_security_group.target-canary-sg.id]
  
    tags = local.tags
  
    depends_on = [module.target_canary_s3_bucket, aws_security_group.target-canary-sg]
  }
```

**Note it is using FEATURE/improving-module branch while in development.**

| endpoints | n/a | <pre>map(object({<br>    url = string<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| existent\_topic\_arn | If create_topic is `false` this is required and is the arn of an already existent topic | `string` | n/a | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"managedby@binbash.co"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-synthetics"` | no |
| runtime_version | Runtime version for the lambda. | `string` | `syn-nodejs-puppeteer-6.2` | no |
| s3\_artifact\_bucket | Location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the test runs of this canary | `string` | n/a | yes |
| schedule\_expression | Expression defining how often the canary runs | `string` | n/a | yes |
| security\_group\_ids | IDs of the security groups for this canary | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| subnet\_ids | IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| topic\_name\_suffix | Topic name suffix, will be prepended with name_prefix | `string` | n/a | yes |
| tags | The json object with tags to be added to resources | `map(string)` | n/a | yes |


## Outputs

| Name | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| topic_arn | The ARN for the alarm topic (whether it is created or already existent, see `create_topic` input) |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
