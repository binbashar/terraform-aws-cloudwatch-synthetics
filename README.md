We are a group of DevOps engineers & architects, joining hands in this ever evolving digital landscape. With our strong belief in Automation; just like microservices, always on the lookout to split the the infrastructure into smaller connected resources (database, cluster and more) which could be standardized, are manageable, scalable, secure & follow industry best practices. 


This module includes Terraform open source, examples, and automation tests (for better understanding), which would help you create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic coding.




## Prerequisites and Providers

This table contains both Prerequisites and Providers:

| Description   | Name                                       | Version   |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:---------:|
| **Prerequisite** | [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) | >= 1.6.6 |
| **Provider** | [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) | >= 5.31.0 |





## Examples

üìå For additional usage examples, check the complete list under [`examples/`](./examples) directory.

Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic Example
```hcl
  module "target-canary" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-synthetics.git?ref=FEATURE/improving-module"
  
    name_prefix = "canary"
    environment = "test"
  
    schedule_expression = "rate(5 minutes)"
    s3_artifact_bucket  = "my-test-artifact-bucket" # must pre-exist
    alarm_email         = null      # an email or null value
    endpoints           = { "target-group" = { url = "http://www.binbash.co/" } }
    managedby           = "managedby@binbash.co"
    repository          = "https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-synthetics"
  
    # what networks it has to work in?
    subnet_ids                = data.terraform_remote_state.local-vpcs.outputs.private_subnets
    security_group_ids        = [aws_security_group.target-canary-sg.id]
  
    tags = local.tags
  
    depends_on = [module.target_canary_s3_bucket, aws_security_group.target-canary-sg]
  }
```

**Note it is using FEATURE/improving-module branch while in development.**
